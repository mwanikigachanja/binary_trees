# Binary Trees Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the implementation and manipulation of binary trees in C. The binary tree is a fundamental data structure that plays a crucial role in various algorithms and applications. The project includes tasks that cover the creation, traversal, insertion, and deletion of nodes in a binary tree.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple tasks, each addressing specific aspects of binary trees. The main source files for the project are:

- **binary_trees.h:** Header file containing structure definitions and function prototypes.
- **0-binary_tree_node.c:** Function to create a new binary tree node.
- **1-binary_tree_insert_left.c:** Function to insert a node as the left-child of another node.
- **2-binary_tree_insert_right.c:** Function to insert a node as the right-child of another node.
- **3-binary_tree_delete.c:** Function to delete an entire binary tree.
- **4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c:** Function to check if a given node is a leaf node.
- **5-binary_tree_is_root.c:** Function to check if a given node is the root of a binary tree.
- **6-binary_tree_preorder.c:** Function to traverse a binary tree in pre-order.
- **7-binary_tree_inorder.c:** Function to traverse a binary tree in-order.
- **8-binary_tree_postorder.c:** Function to traverse a binary tree in post-order.
- **9-binary_tree_height.c:** Function to calculate the height of a binary tree.
- **10-binary_tree_depth.c:** Function to calculate the depth of a given node in a binary tree.
- **11-binary_tree_size.c:** Function to calculate the size (number of nodes) of a binary tree.
- **12-binary_tree_leaves.c:** Function to count the number of leaves in a binary tree.
- **13-binary_tree_nodes.c:** Function to count the number of nodes with at least one child in a binary tree.
- **14-binary_tree_balance.c:** Function to check if a binary tree is balanced.
- **15-binary_tree_is_full.c:** Function to check if a binary tree is full.
- **16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c:** Function to check if a binary tree is perfect.
